# KIVY_ENV 
# 🎮 Project 

This project was created to develop apps for mobile (apk) or for pc, with a particular python framework called Kivymd (and kivy).
Through its libraries it is possible to structure screenmanager, layout and everything that concerns the frontend of the app very amateurishly,
as for the backend it is necessary to use python 3.8. Below is the documentation of them https://kivymd.readthedocs.io/en/1.1.1/index.html.



# 😄Creation 

To create apps, through kivymd you need to create a development environment (virtual envoirment) with pyton 3.8 to avoid a conflict of dependencies given by the libraries. To develop the apk you need to use buildozer and cython to create the .spec file, which is necessary to cook the app. Obviously, it is possible to implement by connecting databases and more.

# 🏛️Buildozer
1. To create the .spec file the following command "Buildozer init"
2. To compile the apk "buildozer -v android debug"



# 👾 Virtual_Envoirment 

To create a virtual environment you need to open the terminal and type:
- cd dekstop 
- mkdir your folder
- cd your folder
- python -m venv your folder
- your folder> \ Script\ Activate 
- Requirements.txt
- New <File.py>
